          <h4> TAKING PHOTOS. </h4>
          <p>
            I like to take photos. I liked to do so since I got my first iPhone in sixth grade. Capturing the transient moments of changing shades
            and hues of light and dark, as well as the natural colors of sunset stroking its brushes across the rigid skylines of concrete
            and the smooth lines of green, was extremely fascinating. 
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:45px;">
            Whether it be sunset, bodies of water, trees, forests, streets, cars passing by,
            flashy neon signs of the night, fast paced movement of workers at lunchtime, or even the smallest of flowers, these stills of my surroundings
            not only serve as a way to take a snapshot of the memories I made, but also provide a way for me to paint my own beauty in my own way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="chanyeolkim20.weebly.com">Here</a> is a collection of the photos I like the most out of the myriad 
            of blurred snapshots along the way.

          <h4> WRITING SONGS. </h4>
          <p>
            I liked listening to music since I was very young. Listening to different types of music redefines what my life at that moment is like.
            Similar to how a BGM can set a tone of the film at that scene, listening to certain types of music can shift the mood of the moment.
            Listening to a mellow ballad while on the streets is going to make me feel completely different from listening to a trap song while walking.
          </p>
          <p>
            I listen to a lot of different types of music.
            <ul>
              <li>Alternative Rock, such as <strong>Coldplay</strong>, Arcade Fire, <u>Amber Run</u>, Muse, Bon Iver</li>
              <li>Hiphop, such as Anderson .Paak, A$AP Rocky, Childish Gambino, Lil Baby, 21 Savage</li>
              <li>Pop and R&B, such as Khalid, Lauv, Isaac Dunbar, Andra Day, Bruno Mars</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            After listening to music for a while and getting to learn more about music in school, I started to become interested in 
            how music was made. Listening to impressive beats with distinct and unique sounds made me think about how they were generated.
            Over time, through self-studying some music theory and tinkering with a few plugins, I was able to create some pieces that I was able to
            call my creation. I mostly create dark hiphop beats in either a trap style or a more ambient, slow vibe. Sometimes I create rock tracks.
