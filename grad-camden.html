<h2> To Camden </h2>
<p>
The amount of work you put into school while being a senior is much more than any five juniors combined. No doubt about it. I mean, just
  look at the grad card. That should be more than five hundred words at the very least
  </p>
<p>
  Everyone says that I appear to be just a quiet and "hardworking" guy, but you and I both know that at this point both descriptions are false.
  AP Stats was a very interesting course - two juniors and like fifteen seniors really brought out the true nature of seniors and senioritis.
  </p>
<p>
  IN PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS no jk I know nothing about psychology; there were seniors who watched soccer, seniors who put on makeup three feet from Gallagher,
  seniors who literally turned their whole body so that their screens do not get shown, seniors who skipped half the class time and came at noon,
  and senior who actually tried. Note that it's in singular - you're the only senior in our class who tried. Unbelievable. You try harder than juniors
  </p>
<p>
  But it was fun talking about life and ranting over how Gallagher just reads off the presentation and never really teaches anything, or about how horrible
  the room smelled like, or how horrible Gallagher's grading system worked out. And doing skribbl.io with Eric, of course, was the best part - it was an honor playing
  with the SIS skribbl io champion. But hey, I was playing on my phone half the games, so I do have a handicap on that.
  </p>
<p>
  My college hopes are failing because of rejections of club execs from everywhere haha, but I'm hoping that Dong Seoul University or Gachon University
  is willing to produce their first student from SIS. I can't wait for senior year because I'll play so hard and not do anything in school at all. 
  Econ and calc BC will require work but never to the same degree of frustration as AP Stat did.
  </p>
<p>
  Side note, AP stats is now a 1v2 class with Eric and I trying to slack off with the least awkward movements as possible while trying to figure out a test for
  the ratio of left handed people in SIS. Gallagher does nothing and just remains in silence. He JUST asked us how the test went, and I tried my best not to say "Did terrible
  thanks to your teaching". There's so much stifling silence surrounding the class, which was unimaginable when seniors were here. Sounds fun, right?
  </p>
<p>
  Good luck in college and beyond while I suffer for one more year in this "school". I'm going to detonate the whole school when I graduate :)
  </p>

  PS: I still didn't use the Starbucks card we got for the NHF photo contest thing, did you?
