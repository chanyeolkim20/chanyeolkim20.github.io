<h2> I'm Paul. </h2>
Just like my namesake, I strive to explore and spread my curiosity and positivity to the people around me.
<p>
I'm a writer, mathematician, editor, singer, researcher, and a programmer. 
  <br>
I was a scientist and a historian. 
  <br>
Sometimes I am a reader and a mentor.
  <br>
I hope I'm looked upon as a friend, a confidante, and above all, a passionate person.
  <br>
Every now and then, I turn into a fidgeter, a photographer, a video editor, and a composer.
  <br>
But all of those traits come into a single mind and create who I truly am as a curious and passionate individual.
  <br>
I don't try to limit myself into one category of a human being, as I try to mold myself into whatever surroundings I'm in.

  <h2> Philippines </h2>
My six years in the Philippines was probably the biggest factor in shaping who I am. Had I continued to live in Korea, my life would have been completely different.
