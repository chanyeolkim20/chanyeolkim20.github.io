<h2> To Kevin </h2>

<p>
  Thank you for everything you've done for yearbook this year! You've made our lives so much better with your leadership and you leading
  us to the fight against Derdeyn that occurred almost every editor meeting we've had and without you we would probably have succumbed
  to some of the weird crazy decisions at the beginning of the year..
  </p>
<p>
  Especially when we were suffering through the major changes in the designs of the yearbook, you setting the example for the club spreads
  and how to approach the theme "Halcyon days" was a great help to not only me but also the entire copy department. Your hard work
  definitely made the yearbook a much more breathable class to be in, and without you this would have been impossible. With you gone,
  I'm sincerely worried about the future of yearbook - especially now that Derdeyn's going, we're in the position of basically revamping
  everything, and it's going to be very hard without you and the other senior editors - just like how people screamed for the necessity of the EIC
  this year, we'll probably scream for you to come back and save us
  </p>
<p>
  As for stats.. I can't believe you tried harder in that class than the juniors. If I were a senior taking that class I would have probably
  skipped half the classes, put on my headphones, and explicitly play games in front of Gallagher who was "teaching" a lesson in the form of
  reciting the words written on the presentation. I think we can both agree that what was taught in that class didn't help us in the AP exam - 
  if it did, then there would have been no need for cramming the FRQs for the mock test :(
  </p>
<p>
  AP Stats is now a 1v2 class with Gallagher on his computer the whole time and not being able to answer our questions while Eric and I
  "design a statistical study". He asked us how the test went last class and I tried my best not to answer "screwed up the FRQs thanks to
  you teaching a lot of content while not reading from the presentation" The absence of seniors is really, really, really big. Three people in that entire classroom..
  </p>
<p>
  Thank you for all the help (whether you intended it or not) you gave me this year, and good luck in college and beyond!
