<h1> Website of Paul Kim </h1>
Welcome to my website. This would contain my milestone achievements as well as projects, 
  resume, and links to other tracks I've left in the Internet.
<br>
Note that I'm building this from scratch using HTML and other relevant languages. The website will look better as I build more knowledge on website development.
