<h2> To William </h2>
<p>
I didn't know people usually write responses to grad cards until yesterday (two days before grad), 
  and my handwriting is pretty terrible anyway, so I'm just writing online on my personal website :)
</p>
<p>
  When I was a freshman, I still remember you as the Theta captain for math club and me being 
  extremely awkward asking you stuff during my FFD shift. And junior year struck and I'm at the point of receiving a grad 
  card from you; it's quite a development I should say.
  </p>
<p>
  I learned a lot from you not just in AP Chem but pretty much everywhere else. Being one of the few seniors who actually kept trying (even in ARML you kept trying, wow; thanks for the hard carry),
  you were truly an inspiration to us, and your junior year life hack tips really saved me, especially when speed reading Midnight's Children.
  I'll never forget the days when you called me Youngjin and kept doing so for months and months, or the time when your camera ran out of battery
  when in Tokyo for NEAMC, or the time when you were working on your college apps even in the extremely high quality rooms in Tokyo, or even you playing the 
  Avengers theme on the piano in the atrium. 
  </p>
<p>
  You're a genuinely great person to get to know, and you've been a lot of help whether you've realized it or not. 
  I should have asked for more help during our Chinese classes; I'm genuinely scared for AP Chinese next year. I shouldn't have registered for that course.
  But calc BC will be fun... right?
  </p>
<p>
  Keep working on the accents! We'll continue to torture Gordon with our terrible "Goo--don"s, and I'll continue to self deprecate haha until I get rejected from colleges this fall; 
  don't worry, math club exec position rejections prepared me enough for college rejections
  </p>
<p>
  Sorry for bad formatting, I only know the basics of HTML :(
  </p>
<p>
  Good luck in college while I suffer in Korea
